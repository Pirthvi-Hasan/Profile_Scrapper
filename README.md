# Profile_Scrapper

## Introduction:
LinkedIn is a Social Networking site with over 750 million users. The User Data is valuable as it can be used to conduct various research. LinkedIn has deployed a strict Anti-Scraping system which makes direct data scraping almost impossible.

The main goal of this project is to develop an algorithm that can bypass anti-scraping algorithms and to extract data of alumni of a particular organization and of a particular domain. Selenium, BeautifulSoup libraries in Python are used. This is used to automate the complete process.

**The program scrapes user data in a specified domain for the specified institute and stores the scraped data as a CSV file in your current working directory.**

## Libraries:
```bash
# Install Python libraries in command line

pip install bs4
pip install requests
pip install selenium
pip install threading
```

> :warning: **Run the code only once in a while.**: As the code uses automated browser for scraping, **Google** and **LinkedIn** will detect frequent requests sent from the bot if run several times. Please do not run the code often. Or else **Your LinkedIn account might get banned. If Possible please use a demo linkedin account.**
